    <p>Kiaora and Talofa friends. It is great to meet you! I am from New Zealand and I am Maori or Indigenous New Zealander. It is quite cold here at the moment but I am excited for the warmer months ahead at Christmas time.</p>
    <p>Two weeks ago, I was basking in the beautiful Samoa sunshine enjoying the food, the beach and doing things I love like dancing and meeting new people. I love to travel especially to warmer climates so the Pacific islands, USA and Europe have been wonderful past holidays. I also enjoy fitness, family, serving in the temple, rugby and eating. 
    </p>
    <p>I have 4 amazing adult children two of whom are married and 3 beautiful grandchildren. My grandchildren bring me the greatest joy. 
        <p>I work in an Osteopathy and own my massage therapy business. </p>
        <p>I am studying the degree Applied Technology BS. It is challenging but I have faith I can do it and I am enjoying learning. Itâ€™s wonderful being with you all.</p>
