            <h3>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h3>
            <p>The Salmon River was given the nickname River of No Return, because of the many of visitors who fell in love with the rugged beauty of the river that they never left!
                Herds of elk, deer, bear and bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted on the hillsides around the river. The river corridor is lined with awe inspiring ponderosa pine which provide shelter to several riverside campsites.
                Let's not forget the rapids! As a free-flowing river, the water is higher, faster, and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. Families with children tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

            <h3>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h3>
            <p>Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip boasts outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and historic human activity, and great white-water opportunities.
                Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  This designation is based on the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.
